  <p class = "lead"> Newton proposed that planetary orbits are mostly elliptical because of the Sun’s gravitation.  The Principia contains the law of universal gravitation and the three Newtonian laws of motion. The law of universal gravitation states that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. The first Newtonian law of motion is the principle of inertia, stating a body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it. The second law states that the change of motion of an object is proportional to the force impressed and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed. The third law states that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. These principles are the groundwork for all modern understanding of movement and physics.</p>
